		<H1>The Sixty Second Sweep</H1>
   		<P>The Sixty Second Sweep is a great way to practice your multiplication facts. There are 31 products in the honeycomb that<br /> 
   		represent all 36 pairs of factors possible with the digits 2 - 9. The numbers in the middle row each have two pairs of<br />
   		factors.Type the factors for the current hexagon to move onto the next one. Type the factors for all 31 hexagons in fewer<br /> 
   		than 60 seconds and you win!</P>
